        <p>
          As the climate warms, more energy is expected to consume within the U.S., and different energy source has been used in the past few years in the U.S.
          
       Increasing energy usage and production are likely to increase emissions of certain air pollutants and greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.
        On this page, a variety of datasets have been used to analyze energy and climate change from 2012 to 2021.
           
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                 <a href="https://xiaojingwu138.github.io/v1/">CO2 Emission Rate Change</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
      
       <p>
          The chart shows that the minimum carbon emission from 2012 to 2021 is the year 2020.
           
         </p>
      <ul>
            <li>
                 <a href="https://xiaojingwu138.github.io/scene2/">Primary Energy Source</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
       <p>
          The chart shows the different energy source consumption values from 2012 to 2021.
           
        </p>
      <ul>
            <li>
                 <a href="https://xiaojingwu138.github.io/v3/">Energy Consumption per Person</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
       <p>
          The chart shows the Energy Consumption per Person Value from 2012 to 2021.

    <h2>About this Visualization</h2>
    <p>
      
    <h3>Messaging</h3>
      <p> 
      The  information listed above provides the energy and climate change data from 2012 to 2021; through the different links, it shows some relation between energy consumption and climate change. 
         </p>
     <h3>Narrative Structure</h3> 
       <p> 
        The narrative visualization is designed to follow the drop-down story. When the user clicks the corresponding title, there is a chart to show the detailed information.
      </p>
      <h3>Visual Structure</h3> 
     <p>  
     When putting the mouse on the corresponding data in the chart, the exact value will pop out. The bar chart indicates the change and trend through the ten years within the U.S.
    </p>

    <h3>Scenes</h3>
    <p>
        There are three scenes in the narrative visualization; each scene is built up from a different dataset. The first scene indicates the change of the climate, the second scene shows the energy source has been used, the third one shows the energy consumption per person, all these three scenes are related and impact from each other. It is order from enviornment to individuals. 
    </p>
    <h3>Annotations</h3>
    <p>
        Annotations are consistent throughout the charts. First, the user will see the trend of the dataset, which indicates the maximum and minimum. When you put the mouse on the data that is interesting, it will shows the exact value.
    </p>
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p>
       The parameters of the narrative visualization are filtered from the dataset and exacted the representative parameters, like date and corresponding value.
    </p>
    <h3>Triggers</h3>
    <p>
        The triggers are implemented via events and tooltips, like the mouseover function,
