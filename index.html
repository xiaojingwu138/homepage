          As the climate warms, more energy is expected to consume within the U.S., and different energy source has been used in the past 
few years in the U.S. Increasing energy usage and production are likely to lead to emissions of certain air pollutants and greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.
Climate change can harm the air and environment. It also causes various health issues, like respiratory and heart diseases. Heath risks will further increase with the increase in climate and energy demand. 
Some data and charts have been used to analyze energy and climate change from 2012 to 2021.

        </ul>
      
       <p>
          The chart shows that the minimum carbon emission from 2012 to 2021 is the year 2020.
         <br /><br />
         
           Carbon dioxide emissions are the primary reason for global climate change. In order to reduce the worst impact impacts of climate change, 
           the reasons are various the energy source, countries, and individuals. Thus, in this page, these related have been used to analyze climate change.

                 <a href="https://xiaojingwu138.github.io/scene2/">Primary Energy Source</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
       <p>
          The chart shows the different energy source consumption values from 2012 to 2021.
<br /><br />
        Primary energy sources include nuclear energy, fossil energy like oil, coal, and natural gas -- and renewable sources like wind, solar, geothermal, and hydropower. This chart includes the trend of energy consumption for fossil energy and renewable energy. Fossil energy is mainly energy cause climate change; 
        it emits significant CO2 during burning. Renewable energy is widely seen as carbon-free‚Äù. There are almost no emit CO2 or other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The usage of fossil energy and renewable energy will have a significant impact on climate change.

            <li>
                 <a href="https://xiaojingwu138.github.io/v3/">Energy Consumption per Person</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
       <p>
          The chart shows the Energy Consumption per Person Value from 2012 to 2021.
        <br /><br />
           Due to climate change, the temperature has significantly increased, the more air conditioning has been used to make it comfortable. Thus, it is expected that individuals will use more energy and mainly electricity for air conditioning.
