        <h3>
          As the climate warms, the more enrergy are expected to consume within U.S., The different energy source has been used in the passed few years within U.S..
          
       Increasing energy usage and production are likely to increase emissions of certain air pollutants and greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.
        In this page, a variety of datasets have been used to analyze the energy and climate change from 2012 to 2021.
           
        </h3>

    <h2>About this Visualization</h2>
    <p>
      
    <h3>Messaging</h3>
      <p> 
      The  information listed above provide the energy and climate change data from 2012 to 2021, through the different links, it shows some relation between energy consumption and climate change. 
         </p>
     <h3>Narrative Structure</h3> 
       <p> 
        The narrative visualization is designed to follow the drop-down story. When the user clicks the corresponding title, there is a chart to show the detailed information.
      </p>
      <h3>Visual Structure</h3> 
     <p>  
     When put the mouse on the corresponding data in the chart, the exact value will pop out. The bar chart indicates the change and trend through the 10 years within U.S..
    </p>

    <h3>Scenes</h3>
    <p>
        There are three scenes in the narrative visulaization, each scene is built up from a different dataset, the first scene indicates the change of the climate, and the second scene shows the energy source has been used, the third one shows the energy consumption per person, all these three scenes are related and impact from each other. It is order from enviornment to individuals. 
    </p>
    <h3>Annotations</h3>
    <p>
        Annotations are consistent through the charts, first, the user will see the trend of the dataset, it indicates the maximum and minimum. when put the mouse on the data that is interested, it will shows the exact value.
    </p>
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p>
       The parameters of the narrative visualization are filtered from the dataset, exacted the representative parameters, like date and corresponding value.
    </p>
    <h3>Triggers</h3>
    <p>
        The triggers are implemented via events and tooltips, like mouseover function,
