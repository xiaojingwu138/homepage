          As the climate warms, more energy is expected to consume within the U.S., and different energy source has been used in the past few years in the U.S.
          
       Increasing energy usage and production are likely to increase emissions of certain air pollutants and greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.
        On this page, a variety of datasets have been used to analyze energy and climate change from 2012 to 2021.
