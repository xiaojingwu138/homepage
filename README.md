- Messaging. 
- What is the message you are trying to communicate with the narrative visualization?

The narrative visualization includes three charts from three different datasets, the CO2 emission rate change, energy source growth rate change, and energy consumption per person, and the datasets are extracted from ten years of data in the United States from the original data source.
The narrative visualization indicates the relationship between energy usage and climate change, and it provides the trend of energy and climate change in the ten years. All of these are helpful for us to take some measures to decrease climate change. 

- Narrative Structure. 
- Which structure was your narrative visualization designed to follow (martini glass, interactive slide show or drop-down story)? How does your narrative visualization follow that structure? (All of these structures can include the opportunity to "drill-down" and explore. The difference is where that opportunity happens in the structure.)

The narrative visualization is designed to follow the interactive slide show structure. The narrative visualization is composed of contents and links; when the user chooses the corresponding link, there is a chart showing detailed information.

- Visual Structure. 
- What visual structure is used for each scene? How does it ensure the viewer can understand the data and navigate the scene? How does it highlight to urge the viewer to focus on the important parts of the data in each scene? How does it help the viewer transition to other scenes, to understand how the data connects to the data in other scenes?
  
Each scene is an interactive slide show structure. There are three options or links in each scene. The user can choose and click those to explore more data and information. A detailed introduction has been listed for each chart. When users put their mouse on the corresponding part of the chart, the exact value of the data will be shown, which helps the user to get more information. When clicking the links, like the home page, scene 1, scene 2, and scene 3 in each scene, the user will be transited to the corresponding scenes.
Moreover, different button options will provide viewers to see the variance of different data. I include a detail description and analysis of each scene and data. It will be helpful for users to understand the relationship and connection of the data in other scenes.

- Scenes. 
- What are the scenes of your narrative visualization? How are the scenes ordered, and why

My narrative visualization has three scenes: the CO2 emission rate change scene, the primary energy source growth rate change scene, and the energy consumption per person scene. The CO2 emission rate mainly represents climate change in the past ten years of the United States. The cause of that change is complicated, one significant reason is energy type and energy usage, so the second and third scenes have provided to show the trend and relationship between them.

- Annotations. 
- What template was followed for the annotations, and why that template? How are the annotations used to support the messaging? Do the annotations change within a single scene, and if so, how and why
  
D3-tooltip has been added for the charts; when the user moves their mouse on the data, the corresponding value will be shown at the bottom of the page, but chart 2, provides information on the change of different sources.

- Parameters. 
- What are the parameters of the narrative visualization? What are the states of the narrative visualization? How are the parameters used to define the state and each scene?
  
The parameters of the narrative visualization are a handful, and it is helpful for users to understand further and navigate the data and scene. Charts are different due to category and energy source. For the second scene, the user can click different buttons to explore the value change based on the different energy sources.

- Triggers. 
- What are the triggers that connect user actions to changes of state in the narrative visualization? What affordances are provided to the user to communicate to them what options are available to them in the narrative visualization?
  
"transition", "mouseover‚Äù, and" mouseout" triggers have been used to connect user actions to change of state in the narrative visualization. The function will be invoked based on the user's actions. The button and values with the mouse move are examples of trigger actions.
